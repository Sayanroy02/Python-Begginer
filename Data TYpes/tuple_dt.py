#Tuple is similir to list but you cannot perform operations in tuple

my_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5) # store information that will not be changed , so tuples data cannot be change or edited .

#Access a element using indexing 

two = my_tuple[1]  #1 inside square bracket "1" indicates the index number of the tuple elements
